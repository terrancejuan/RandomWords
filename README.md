# RandomWords
Create a RANDOMLY sized array of Strings
For each String in the array:
    Randomly select a length for the random word (you can put lower and upper limits on the length)
    Randomly BUILD that string to represent an ACTUAL word. IE, a word that exists in out lexicon

After you establish your array of randomly generated “real” words:
SORT the array by 2 criteria:  from smallest words to largest words and, within these sets, sort
lexicographically. For example:
    And
    But
    Cat
    Dog
    Melt
    None
    Pole
    Apple
    Bacon
    ...
